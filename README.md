Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves processing and analyzing textual data to determine its emotional tone. In this project, we utilize the IMDB Movie Review dataset-a collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a review.

To achieve this, we employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a powerful machine learning technique suited for complex data patterns. The ANN model will undergo hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search or Random Search, focusing on key hyperparameters, including the number of layers, learning rate, activation functions, and batch size. This optimization helps to identify the most effective architecture and settings for the model.
